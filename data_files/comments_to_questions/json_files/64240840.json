So &#39;blaming the tools&#39; ? yes, but as I said before I do realise I am at the bleeding edge, so I don&#39;t blame anyone."

Weirdly it added sqlite as a dependency (not sure why - yet) but the code it creates does use DI for the context so I tried it again with just the context and the mapper enabled and it has failed again. I am going to try and call the scaffolded controller - see what happens..."
