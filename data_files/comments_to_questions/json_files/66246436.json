A different approach would be to tweak the router logic a bit. If you are interested, I could create a quick example."

Now if i navigate from here to any page decorated with policies it also works fine. The problem is when anybody directly loads any url decorated with policy(like copy paste url to new tab) . In this case if the token stored in the local storage is not expired it will directly load the page and get the error &#39;policy not found&#39; because the page gets loaded even before initializing the policy after async httpclient request"
