Anyhow, If you&#39;re using the token based authentication (API), you can attach an event handler to the RemoteAuthenticatorView component located in the Authentication component. I think it has an event that is invoked immediately after a user log in. As far as I recall, I&#39;ve once answered a similar question that way, and then changed my answer to something more useful. Try this solution, and let us know if it&#39;s OK."
