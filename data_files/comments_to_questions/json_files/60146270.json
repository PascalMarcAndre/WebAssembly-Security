I just want to ensure there was no network interaction. From node.js I only passed the file system module to the the library. In the decompiled output I don&#39;t see any suspicious headers, but please verify if my assumption is correct: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/YYHecFAC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">pastebin.com/YYHecFAC</a> (first lines of the decompiled output)"

All it can do (in the context of node anyway) is call the JS functions that you give it.   If you want to see what its doing one way is to annotate all the imports you pass to it."

This is a way of sandboxing packages and prevent them from abusing package managers privileges, breaking other projects and keep application under security context.  It does same  when you install node-sass or node-dart or any other package which has C library binding. It executes Cmake to compile binary for your platform and then includes it."
