        "body": "On Intel-uarchs, the code that computes the multiplication of the uppermost bit separately uses just as many long-latency multiplying instructions as the <code>vpmullw</code>-using code, and as many instructions in total. I would expect it to have similar throughput, but it has worse latency, because its dependency tree is deeper. You might try to replace one of the <code>vpmaddubsw</code> with an <code>AND</code> with the result of a byte-comparison with zero, because it only has a single bit of input, avoiding the costly multliplying instruction, but using more shift instructions."

        "body": "The saturation is what kills this idea. Converting signed/unsigned multiplication to unsigned/unsigned would be easy enough, just add <code>((signed&gt;&gt;8)&amp;unsigned)&lt;&lt;8</code> to the result. Even the <code>add</code> part of <code>pmaddubsw</code> wouldn&#39;t normally hurt, because normally binary addition (signed or unsigned) is associative. But saturating addition is <i>not</i> associative, so you can&#39;t fix the signedness of the multiplication if the addition saturated."
