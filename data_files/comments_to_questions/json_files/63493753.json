I figured out the cause, the client Id wasn&#39;t prepended with the scheme/protocol, which seems odd that it had this effect. This specific line is called out here: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/standalone-with-microsoft-accounts?view=aspnetcore-3.1#code-try-5\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/&hellip;</a>, but they describe it as &quot;try either one&quot; which I find odd.  Is there a tutorial doc/overview of the custom user factory to process roles/groups claims? I&#39;m really struggling to find an overview of this process."
