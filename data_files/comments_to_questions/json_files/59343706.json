There&#39;s no option to stitch the files on disk because it has to go through the browser, and the whole thing is a hack in the first place where the bytes are just sent to the vm. That&#39;s why I mentioned the manual stitching (i.e. download 4 files and manually concatenate them with another program external from the blazor app). Until there&#39;s support for streaming directly from the blazor app I think it will be very tricky to make work"
