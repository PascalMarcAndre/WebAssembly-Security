Do you mean that you want to create a login form in the WebAssembly app in which some code may authenticate the user, internally pass id-token to Blazor, etc. In other words, you don&#39;t wish Blazor to re-direct the user to the IdentityServer provider for authentication. You don&#39;t want to see the Login page provided by IdentityServer4, but you want one tailored by you."
