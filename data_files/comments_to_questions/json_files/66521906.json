I&#39;ve just tried taking the API call out of the equation, hard-coded the token string in the Blazor app, and attempted to decode it in isolation after the app has initialised.  I get exactly the same result, i.e. when running in localhost via Visual Studio 2019, it decodes perfectly; when running it from the webserver, the same error as above.  The app uses System.IdentityModel.Tokens.Jwt, Version=6.8.0.0.  The only thing that is different is the fact that it&#39;s being served by a web server. Could it be some IIS config?"
