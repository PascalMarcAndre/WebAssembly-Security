Additionally it illustrate the use of the AuthorizeView component to secure your content, and allow access to authorized users only. </p>\n\n<p>Then see <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/60284148/6152891\">this answer</a> to get some idea how you can save your Jwt token on the local storage, how to retrieve it, and how to use it to perform HTTP calls.</p>\n\n<p>Note: What is missing here a way to extract a claim from your Jwt token and pass it to your AuthorizationHandler. This merits a new question...</p>\n\n<p>You also need to implement the StateAuthenticationProvider which may be combined with the Jwt token mechanism which is shown in my answer ( I call it TokenProvider)</p>\n\n<p>From what you describe in your question I get the impression that every thing is new to you, so I'd suggest you <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">start here...</a> </p>\n\n<p>hope this helps...</p>\n"
