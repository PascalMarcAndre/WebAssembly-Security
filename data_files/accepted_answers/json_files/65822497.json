    "body": "<p>I was able to upload a file with your code. It was working like a charm. So, there is no error in your source code. I used the <code>Microsoft.NET.Sdk.BlazorWebAssembly</code> SDK with <code>net5.0</code> as the target framework. Probably, it's a configuration issue with the storage account.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pi8PN.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/pi8PN.png\" alt=\"CORS policies\" /></a></p>\n<p>The CORS policy allows the host of the application (https://localhost:5001) to accesses the resources with any verb and any header (*) values. The response can include the <code>content-length</code> header. Is your WASM self hosted or hosted within an ASP core application? You can easily spot what origin is sent to azure by inspected the request.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UqWNM.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/UqWNM.png\" alt=\"what origin is used to send a request\" /></a></p>\n<p>Based on your context, only a few verbs like <strong>PUT</strong> might be enough.</p>\n<p>The configuration of the SAS key can also be more specific.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ll0sd.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/ll0sd.png\" alt=\"Configuration for SAS\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>Using SAS from Blazor WASM</strong></p>\n<p>Even not entirely part of your questions, but worth mentioning. If you want to allow a direct upload into your blob storage - and there are good reasons for it - before uploading a file, your WASM app should send a request to your API, the response contains the SAS key that can only be used for this one operation. The SAS key itself should be a <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview?toc=/azure/storage/blobs/toc.json#user-delegation-sas\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">user delegation SAS key</a></p>\n"
