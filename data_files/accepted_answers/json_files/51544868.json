Practically speaking, this means that the peak memory usage of your WebAssembly application is also the <strong>permanent</strong> memory usage.</p>\n\n<p>For a given problem, it may be possible to tweak your algorithm to reduce the peak amount of memory.</p>\n\n<p>I don't have the knowledge or ability to test this, but one out-of-the-box idea would be to try and have multiple WebAssembly runtimes distinct from each other. You could chew up a lot of memory in one to compute a relatively small result, serialize that result outside of the WASM runtime, then throw it away and spin up a new one. This is likely only to be useful in certain specific problem domains.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>In the future, memory resizing may be <strong>re</strong>-added to WebAssembly. It was explicitly removed before the MVP release:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>After the MVP, we are moving to things that diverge and cannot be polyfilled, and memory resizing makes more sense to add at that point in time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/issues/294\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Remove memory resizing from the MVP (294)</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/design/pull/389\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Only allow memory growth in MVP (389)</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/442252698964721669/443151097398296587/472096547635462156\" rel=\"noreferrer\">alexcrichton</a> and <a href=\"https://discordapp.com/channels/442252698964721669/443151097398296587/472096596725858314\" rel=\"noreferrer\">steveklabnik</a> for answering this question in the Rust Discord.</p>\n"
