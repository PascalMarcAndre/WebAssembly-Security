    "body": "<p>No, there is no way to access the current URL from a WebAssembly module without interoperating with the JavaScript host. In fact, WebAssembly cannot do <em>anything</em> without the host's help! It is design to have no I/O capabilities.</p>\n\n<p>Furthermore, even if it could access the URL - it would still not be a very robust security model. It is very easy to decompile and modify a WebAssembly module. Any code you deploy to the web, regardless of the language you use, can be stolen!</p>\n"
