The complexity would be enormous, and the effect on maintainability and security would probably be severe.</p>\n\n<p>The web interface to WebAssembly modules (through the <code>Wasm</code> object) provides a clean and simple way to interface between JS and Wasm. In the future, ES6 modules might simplify interop further. It's not obvious what advantage a complicated mechanism like you propose would have over that.</p>\n"
