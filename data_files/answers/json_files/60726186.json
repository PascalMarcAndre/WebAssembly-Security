My question then is, is this really necessary to have in server-side blazor project because the site I was following did not add it. <a href=\"https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-2-release-now-available/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/blazor-webassembly-3-2-0-preview-2-release-now-available/</a></p>\n\n<p>Secondly I believe the real issue is when I changed the base href tag. If I create a new project, change the connection string and run it, everything is good. If I then stop the application, change the </p>\n\n<pre><code>&lt;base href=\"/client-side-blazor/\"/&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>(including trailing slash) in index.html and add </p>\n\n<pre><code>app.UsePathBase(\"/client-side-blazor\")\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>to server-side blazor startup.cs, and then rerun the application it no longer works as before. and calls to the weather forcast controller responds with 401.</p>\n"
