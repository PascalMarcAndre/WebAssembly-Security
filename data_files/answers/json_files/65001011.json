Thanks a lot.</p>\n<p>One thing I'd like to point out that with .NET 5 being released and with the latest update to Visual Studio 2019, there is now a Blazor WebAssembly template for Work or School Accounts (i.e. Azure AD authentication). I created my app with this template and assumed it would set everything up correctly. It does not.</p>\n<p>The client app registration has the redirect URIs set up as Web instead of SPA. This was the first issue I encountered and had to change it manually after doing some research. The second problem was this audience setting being discussed here. I hope Microsoft cleans up these bugs in the template soon because I'm sure there will be a lot of confused developers out there.</p>\n"
