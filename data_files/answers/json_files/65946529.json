Using <code>SIDE_MODULE</code> enables emscripten dynamic linking (PIC) ABI which you probably don't want.</p>\n<p>Building with <code>--no-entry</code> and with an output file ending in <code>.wasm</code> should be enough to build something that is as sand-alone as possible.  However remember that emscripten's output is really designed to be run by emscripten-generated JS so you may run into complications trying to load it yourself like this.</p>\n"
