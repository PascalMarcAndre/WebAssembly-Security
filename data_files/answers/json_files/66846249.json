        "body": "<p>No, if you look at the BlazingPizza sample, you can easily tell it's a .NET Core <em>hosted</em> app (vs. a pure web assembly app) by noticing that among their folders in <code>src</code> are <code>BlazingPizza.Client</code> and <code>BlazingPizza.Server</code>.  This means that while the <em>client</em> is implemented using web assembly, all its data access logic occurs through the use of the ASP.NET Core Web API backend.  It's the backend (which is just a normal .NET app with full access to the framework) that is using SQLite to store data.  The web assembly portion (<code>BlazingPizza.Client</code>) simply uses standard REST API interactions to query the backend for its data.  (Importantly, a web assembly app <em>cannot</em> use the .NET SQLite drivers.)</p>\n<p>Therefore, trying to see this as a replacement for LocalStorage misses the mark as it's not actually storing anything on the client.</p>\n"
