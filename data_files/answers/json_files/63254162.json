You didn't state what hardware you use but on my Desktop (i7) I can download in &lt; 100 ms (Localhost) and Deserialization takes &lt; 4 seconds. Not much difference between Debug and Release mode or between Browsers.</p>\n<p>So, 5 seconds to just download from localhost is already very strange. Something is wrong in your setup.</p>\n<p>An MCVE:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Start with the Wasm Hosted template</li>\n<li>Make the controller return ~17000 items (was 5) to get ~ 1.5 MB</li>\n<li>Put your code in the FetchData OnInit(), replace Foo with WeatherForecast</li>\n<li>Don't try to render them all.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>See what results you get for this.</p>\n"
