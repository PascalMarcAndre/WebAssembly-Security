A factory can achieve this for you then you will be able to use standard blazor components / mechanisms to manage them.</p>\n<p>Even with the Individual user accounts option you have to do this as the claims come in a comma separated string.</p>\n<p>This is a link for an <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-identity-server?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio#custom-user-factory\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">example</a>. This is not your case but the solution is the same you need to transform the claims you have to what blazor expects.</p>\n"
