        "body": "<p>Thanks for all the suggestions, Jason. Helped me head in the right direction.</p>\n<p>The problem was quite silly. Apparently the Database and Entity Framework settings had automatically come up with the same string for both my &quot;Users&quot; and &quot;Todos&quot; databases:</p>\n<pre><code>Data Source=tcp:myserver.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=todos;User Id=&lt;myid&gt;@myserver;Password=&lt;my-password&gt;\n</code></pre>\n<p>But I hadn't noticed that it was the same string. I just had to change <code>Initial Catalog</code> to <code>users</code> and re check the &quot;use this connection string at runtime&quot; and &quot;apply this migration on publish&quot; boxes again with the edited string. That solved the issue.</p>\n"
