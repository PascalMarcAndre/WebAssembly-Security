I think I have found a better one.</p>\n<p>The original issue occurred because openid-configuration contained URLs using different schema: http instead of https. We can change the base URL used by IdentityServer by registering it this way in Startup.cs:</p>\n<pre><code>services.AddIdentityServer(\n        options =&gt; {\n            options.PublicOrigin = Configuration.GetValue&lt;string&gt;(&quot;PublicOrigin&quot;);\n        })\n</code></pre>\n<p>Surely, we also have to provide a correct URL in appsettings.json:</p>\n<pre><code>{\n  //snip\n  &quot;PublicOrigin&quot;: &quot;https://subdomain.domain.com&quot;,\n  //snip\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now it works just fine for me.</p>\n"
