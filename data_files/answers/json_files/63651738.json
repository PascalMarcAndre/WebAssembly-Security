If you change the server from IIS to 'your app' in the dropdown next to the green 'Debug Start' button, the the server will run standalone and hopefully circumvent some of the issues currently experienced by IIS.\nIts not a strict 'answer' but should hopefully be a solution... worked for me anyway.</p>\n<p><strong>I need to modify that answer</strong> and will leave these edits till we figure it out...\nI just added back some new code that I had removed, thinking they were possibly breaking changes, and it has failed again. I don't understand why since all I have put in is a static BLL Helper class and a controller for helping setup. All very so so. I have removed them again and it still doesn't work. There is a strange issue here. I'll come back when I know more. If you find anything, please post a comment.</p>\n<p>Cheers</p>\n"
