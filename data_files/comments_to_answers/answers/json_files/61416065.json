You'll need either a debug build, or a release build with the <code>v8_enable_disassembler = true</code> GN arg.</p>\n\n<p>There's no existing way to retrieve generated code via V8's API; so if that's what you want, then you'd have to add it. Keep in mind that V8 is not designed to be a standalone compiler, which means generated code assumes that it's going to run \"inside V8\", so if you wanted to use it for anything else, you'd have to make significant modifications.</p>\n"
