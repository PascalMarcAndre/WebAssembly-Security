WebAssembly has no built in I/O, therefore you can run code in such a way that it can do no harm at all. For practical purposes you\u2019d want to provide a secure API which this code could use in order to perform any useful functions. In your case this sounds very simple - your API simply allows a string to be exchanged.</p>\n\n<p>However, there are some simpler alternatives - see this excellent blog post from Figma that discusses that specifically:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.figma.com/blog/how-we-built-the-figma-plugin-system/</a></p>\n\n<p>It also discusses various other useful options such as Realms.</p>\n"
