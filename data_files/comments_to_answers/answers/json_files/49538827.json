It is obfuscated a little, but hardly private.</p>\n\n<p>The code is delivered in a binary format, however using readily available tools, e.g. <code>wasm2wat</code>, this can easily be converted into a human readable text format. The text is a relatively low level language, but still quite readable. It will not protect your algorithms, it will simply take people a little longer to understand them.</p>\n\n<p>WebAssembly is not readily transformable back to higher level languages (e.g. C++), but this does not make your algorithm private.</p>\n"
