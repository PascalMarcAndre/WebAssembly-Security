That being said, the <code>HttpContext.Request.Cookies</code> collection is still empty. I&#39;ve also tried using <code>Http.DefaultRequestHeaders.Add(&quot;Set-Cookie&quot;, $&quot;myCookie={someValue}&quot;)</code>, but that still doesn&#39;t populate the collection. I don&#39;t know how much it matters if I can still read the cookie value from the header, but it&#39;s puzzling nonetheless."
