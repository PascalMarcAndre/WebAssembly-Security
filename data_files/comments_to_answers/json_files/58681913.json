We have some complected algorithm that we need to run and we wanted to share the same webasm code in the browser and in the embedded app so, as I see it, I have no choice but to use the v8 API. From your comment I understand now what I need to do. I will do it and post a working example when I&#39;ll get it running. Thanks for your help!"

I don&#39;t know of a good example you could follow, but that&#39;s the general concept. The Wasm C API makes all this much easier."

        "body": "thanks for the quick and elaborate reply. I followed your advice and figure out that I need to pass a second argument to <i>args_type instance_args{module,</i> <b>imports</b> <i>};</i> that will include the import table. I&#39;ve tried to figure out how to create this import object and populate it with host function ( in my case the host <i>rand()</i> function but without any help. Reading in <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wasm-c-api\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">link</a> I&#39;ve noticed that this might not even being supported by V8 ( for now ). Any idea if it&#39;s indeed not supported or am I missing something. 10x"
