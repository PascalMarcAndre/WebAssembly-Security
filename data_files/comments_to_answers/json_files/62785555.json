Session storage persists (user state) only in the current browsing session as it&#39;s only stored in the browser cache, local storage persists even if you close your current browsing session/open a new tab as it&#39;s stored in your local machine&#39;s temp folder (iirc).  Hope that helps :)"

        "body": "Thank you. I actually tried it this way and my example way and both failed. Turns out I had to restart my whole computer as Visual Studio (19) was holding onto some sort of cache causing the errors. Once I restarted, then I could do it the way you showed here. One thing though, you must be using a different Blazored library or version because ISessionStorageService  doesn&#39;t exist in the one I am talking about -- it is ILocalStorageService. I&#39;ll go ahead and mark this as answered though."
