        "body": "Thanks for the very fast response, Henk! When the app is set up this way the Blazor application still intercepts requests to <a href=\"https://localhost:44331/api/anything\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">localhost:44331/api/anything</a> and displays a page that says &quot;there is nothing at this address&quot;. If possible, I would expect a request like this to deliver raw JSON from the web api, or an error, instead of a page on the Blazor WASM app, because I only want the client app to be involved when the URL does not have the &quot;/api&quot; path. Do you see what I mean?"
