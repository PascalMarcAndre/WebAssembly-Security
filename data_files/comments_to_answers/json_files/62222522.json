For instance, when a sequence container such as std::vector requires an underlying reallocation, outstanding iterators, pointers, and references will be invalidated</a>.&quot;"

What works is if i copy the memroy from the vector to another  &quot;char* char_array &quot;  using the new operator and  then send the pointer of that char_array. Thus my question was is the vector &quot;garbage collected&quot; in this case since it is living on the stack and was that the reason why direct pointer from vector is not producing the results i wanted?"
