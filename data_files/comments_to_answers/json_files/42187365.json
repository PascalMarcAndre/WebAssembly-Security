There is a quantitative difference between what both languages can do, but it&#39;s way too small to be a qualitative one for the purpose in question. Any DRM technique you could apply to Wasm you could also apply to JS."

But can&#39;t one &quot;inspect and step through any DRM code in text form&quot; with e.g. GDB and see the machine instructions in symbolic form? How does compiled C -&gt; binary library provide &quot;better&quot; DRM protection than C -&gt; WASM?"
