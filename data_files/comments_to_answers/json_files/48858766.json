        "body": "The case in point is an electron app - so it uses both nodejs and chrome. It is also widely considered impossible to protect, but if you move part of the logic in node C++ modules, it&#39;s perfectly possible. So I was wondering if a similar thing can be done with Chrome. But I didn&#39;t ask the right question :) So If there&#39;s no &quot;native code&quot; in Chrome and it can only run Webassembly and JS, yet webassembly is limited to math operations only, then... yeah :) Thanks for the help!"
