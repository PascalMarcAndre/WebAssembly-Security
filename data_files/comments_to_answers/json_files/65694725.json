        "body": "Thanks. I was to call the Microsoft Graph API for a user that previously authenticated via Azure B2C using a Microsoft account (one of the social IDPs we integrate with). Because they authenticated with a Microsoft account I know that they have access to OneNote (via Microsoft Graph API). I was hoping to avoid them having to log in a second time to access the Microsoft Graph API, but your answer doesn&#39;t address this scenario. I don&#39;t want to access the B2C tenant via Graph API but OneNote. Or are you saying that I can access the user&#39;s OneNote files via Graph API and B2C tenant?"
