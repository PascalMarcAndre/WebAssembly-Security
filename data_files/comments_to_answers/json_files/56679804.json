        "body": "@Henk Holterman, your answer is contains two quotes, each of which is accompanied by a suggestion. I&#39;ve already related to the first quote, now I shall relate to the second one:  HttpHandler, in its simplest sense is a class (process) that handles incoming requests made to the ASP.NET websites. Web Service Handler (.asmx) is a good example. Indeed, &quot;API server exposing endpoints to the client&quot;, or Web Api controller class, is the replacement of the old Asp.Net HTTPHandlers in Asp.Net Core. But how can you conclude from this that Hosted model should be chosen!"
