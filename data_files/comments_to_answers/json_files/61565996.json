        "body": "Thank you! I got this to work. The out-of-the box Blazor hosted client template already creates a RedirectToLogin.razor control. However, different to yours, the default RediriectToLogin redirects to the page Authentication.razor, which is also provided by the template. I wanted to preserve this and thus had to add a new, empty Layout to be used by the Authentication.razor page. Otherwise the Authentication page would load the MainLayout.razor again and RedirectToLogin and off it went in a silly loop :-) I got one step further in this adventure, thanks for your help!"
