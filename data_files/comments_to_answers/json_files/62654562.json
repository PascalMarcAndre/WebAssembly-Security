I&#39;ve been researching for the best way to handle this in Blazor Web Assembly, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much documentation on that part. Documentation seems to only cover Authentication and Authorization, and not the actual registration of new users. It sounds as if you&#39;re registering users from within Identity Server, but I&#39;m curious as exactly how you are handling that from within the blazor client. Do you have any sample code or documentation that I can view?"
