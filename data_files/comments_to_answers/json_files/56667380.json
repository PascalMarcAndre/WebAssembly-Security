Now I would like to learn Blazor but cannot find a clear description (clear to me, at least) of the differences between HTML5 with Ajax and Blazor, in respect to how the two architectures avoid refreshing the entire page when the user interacts with it.  I believed that SignalR may eliminate the need to use Ajax for that effect, but am not certain of that"

Does the server invoke (remotely) a client-side method and supply the data as an argument to the client-side method?"

I thought WASM could run server-side too. I am thinking of intranet apps, not internet apps, in terms of number of clients (relatively few)."
