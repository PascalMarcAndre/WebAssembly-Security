Nobody knows just how slow JavaScript compiled to WebAssembly would be for typical applications because nobody has tried it, but 10x-100x slower than running it on V8 directly is a reasonable estimate, I think."

I&#39;ve researched the topic long enough and the reason I&#39;m posting here is to hopefully get a response from devs with deep V8 experience that can explain how the &quot;Script::Compile&quot; function works, what it does, is it limited in API capabilities, etc."

Simply speaking, a JS VM first compiles a JS program to very slow code, profiles it while running, and then recompiles it to something more optimised, often over and over again, while the program is still running. For that, it needs to have the original JS program or something equivalent. An offline compiler could likewise only generate very slow code initially, but with no way of recompiling and optimising it while running."

The webassembly native code is meant to perform mostly math calculations - and it&#39;s doing it tens of times faster than standard JS - event with all its dynamic optimisations, and so on. That&#39;s why it exists - speed. And you don&#39;t know what language was used to generate this webassembly native code - it could be c++, rust, anything. How come if it was javascript, it becomes 100x slower? The only possible problem I see is if the native code is limited to only certain operations - like lack of DOM. Speed is absolutely not the problem here."
