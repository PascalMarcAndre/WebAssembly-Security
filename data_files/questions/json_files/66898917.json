    "title": "blazor webassembly .net 5.0 unregister service-worker",
    "body": "<p>I have a Blazor Webassembly app that uses authentication via Google, Facebook and Twitter. When I login and logout or I switch between authorization providers (on my development environment), everything works as expected. However when I publish it to IIS (for production): I can login the first time (with Google for example) but after I logout, I can not login again. I noticed that if I unregister the service-worker.js, everything works as expected. So if I unregister the service-worker after logout... it all works and I can login again.</p>\n<p>With that said, I tried the code bellow to execute on logout and unregister the service-worker:</p>\n<pre><code>    window.RemoveWorker = () =&gt; {\n        navigator.serviceWorker.getRegistrations().then(function (registrations) {\n            for (let registration of registrations) {\n                registration.unregister()\n            }\n        });\n        return true;\n    };\n</code></pre>\n<p>After I tested it, it did not work... I still have to use F12 to use the browser dev tools to unregister the server-worker and then I ca login again. Any hints or ideas would be appreciated.</p>\n"
