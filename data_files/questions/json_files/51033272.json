    "body": "<p>I am developing an app with Cordova + Webassembly.</p>\n\n<p>The customer needs the app to work on Windows and Android.\nI am using Visual Studio 2017 + TACO.</p>\n\n<p>The webassembly is generated from C/C++ code using emscripten and is working all fine on Edge and Chrome. It is also working on an Android device (Chrome)</p>\n\n<p>The Cordova app running on Windows is working perfectly.</p>\n\n<p>Now my problem is on Android. The Cordova app on Android log this error:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Fetch API cannot load file:///android_asset/www/script/myApp.wasm. URL scheme \"file\" is not supported.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I can't find anywhere if Cordova supports WebAssembly on Android. My understanding is Android is using a WebView component and should rely on Google Chrome (my Webassembly is working fine on Chrome on Android).\nIs there an option somewhere to add a mime-type for cordova on android?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks in advance for any help.</p>\n"
