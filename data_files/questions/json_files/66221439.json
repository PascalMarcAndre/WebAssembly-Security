    "title": "Blazor WebAssembly Application fails to load due to integrity errors",
    "body": "<p>We have developed a Blazor WebAssembly Application that has already gone into productive usage for a certain group of customers.</p>\n<p>The Application works well in all Browsers with Standard Security settings. However, this morning I got a call from one of the customers, where the Application did not load at all in their Chrome Browser.</p>\n<p>I saw the following Errors in the console:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>Unknown error occurred while trying to verify integrity.</code></li>\n<li><code>Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 (forbidden)</code></li>\n<li><code>Failed to find a valid digest in the 'integrity' attribute for ressource '&lt;somepath.dll&gt;' with SHA-256 integrity &lt;sha56&gt;. the resource has been blocked</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Now my question is, what could cause this? Is this a Browser Security setting, or another security setting e.g on server, in code etc.? How can I fix this?</p>\n<p>Here's a picture of the errors mentioned above</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CuCOO.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/CuCOO.png\" alt=\"Console Errors Blazor Chrome\" /></a></p>\n"
