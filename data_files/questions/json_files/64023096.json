    "body": "<p>I am trying to deploy ASP.NET Core Hosted Blazor Webassembly Application in a Windows Server 2016 (in AWS).\nThe application gets hosted without any error in IIS. But while the application reaches the code section related to verifying a certificate instance I get the following exception:</p>\n<p><code>One or more errors occurred. (Access is denied.)</code></p>\n<p>I have also tried the same in Windows 10 Pro and the exception is not thrown. In Windows server 2016, I have tried running the application directly using executable and it works as expected and exception is not thrown in this approach.</p>\n<p>I have also launched the IIS with administrative privileges and still the issue persists. Does this problem arise due to Windows user access privileges? How can I resolve the above mentioned exception?</p>\n"
