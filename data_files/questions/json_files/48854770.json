    "title": "Can you compile JS code using V8 and feed that directly to Chrome?",
    "body": "<p>I'm looking for a way to protect some javascript code from reading/modifying. I know many people consider that impossible, but still...</p>\n\n<p>From what I see the Chrome's V8 engine does a number of optimizations when it sees JS code, probably compiles it (?) and then runs it.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm wondering is it possible to use V8's C++ api to compile the JS code into machinecode/chromecode and then feed that directly into Chrome (I don't care about other browsers)?\nSupposedly it will not only be faster, but also non-humanly readable, something like ASM.</p>\n\n<p>Is this possible?</p>\n\n<p>WebAssembly is doing this thing so I don't understand why we can't do it with JS code.\nThere's also EncloseJS and pkg that are doing a very similar thing.</p>\n"
