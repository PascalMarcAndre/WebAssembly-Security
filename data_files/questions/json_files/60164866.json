    "title": "Blazor fallback for older browsers",
    "body": "<p>For context : I wanted to make a simple bot-detection mechanism (captcha) on a registration page. So I decided to have an iframe with a small Blazor client-side app that just shows a checkbox and does some C# operations (hashing a variable with a salt). Since this gets compiled to wasm, it would be pretty hard to bypass. I realize it's not impossible, but for a small site it should be more than enough. It's more userfriendly than having to type something, and it doesn't have dependencies on 3rd party tools like google's recaptcha.</p>\n\n<p>But obviously, this will not work on older browsers. I could show an alternative captcha for those browsers, but the Blazor docs are not very helpful when it comes to browser support (they just say \"latest\").</p>\n\n<p>Is there a way to determine whether a browser will be able to handle Blazor correctly? </p>\n\n<p>Would it be good enough to just detect if the browser supports WebAssembly? Or does Blazor have other requirements?</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"
