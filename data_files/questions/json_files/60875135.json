    "body": "<p>We're currently looking at OpenSilver, which is a open-source reimplementation of Silverlight.\nIt runs on browsers via WebAssembly. It uses Mono for WebAssembly and Microsoft Blazor.\nIt runs without the need for browser extensions.</p>\n\n<p>The examples I've seen so far require it be hosted in IIS. \nFrom within Visual studio, it can be hosted via IIS Express or a simulator.</p>\n\n<p>Our clients have security requirements that prohibit them from web applications (hosted in IIS).</p>\n\n<p>We are evaluating OpenSilver as a potential cross platform solution.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to run as a standard alone or self hosted application?\nI know Qt/QML has a browser control that let's you load html pages directly.\nI'm pretty sure that's not going to help us at all.\nAre there any alternatives for this?</p>\n\n<p>Thx</p>\n"
