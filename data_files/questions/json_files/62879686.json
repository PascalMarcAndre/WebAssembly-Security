    "body": "<p>I'm learning blazor and am having some difficulty wrapping my head around authentication.  I have a .net core web api hosted and want to connect a blazor web assembly to it, but all the tutorials i find use it hosted in an asp.net core host in one package. How secure is the authentication when hosted like this on the same machine?</p>\n"
