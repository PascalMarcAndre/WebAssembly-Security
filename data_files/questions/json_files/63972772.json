    "title": "Blazor not correctly redirecting to controller on IIS",
    "body": "<p>I have started on a blazor-webassembly PWA project (.net 5.0-rc1), hosted on asp.net core, and is working Authentication against 3rd party services.<br />\nThis login flow is based on asp.net core identity.<br />\nThe flow is as follows:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>User enters login site and chooses a provider</li>\n<li>User is redirected to controller, loading provider configuration and redirects user to provider</li>\n<li>User log in using provider</li>\n<li>User is redirected to callback, and is logged into system, JWT is generated</li>\n<li>User is redirected to PWA for handling of JWT.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>When developing locally, the above flow works without any issues.<br />\nHowever when deploying to my webhotel, step 2 is redirected to the Blazor application, rather than the controller on the server, causing a &quot;Not found&quot; page.</p>\n<p>As the server is hosting the application they share the same base url.<br />\nI have tried both a regular link &lt;a href=&quot;...&quot;&gt; and navigate with Navigationmanager.NagivateTo(url, forLoad: true);</p>\n<p>When shown the &quot;Not Found&quot; page, pressing F5 will result in the same page. However pressing Ctrl+F5 causes the server endpoint to be hit, and the rest of the flow works as intented.</p>\n"
