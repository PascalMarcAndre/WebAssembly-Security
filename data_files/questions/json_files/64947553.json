    "body": "<p>I have a hosted WASM website using Azure's AAD B2C for user authentication and authorization.  The root of the website is a simple landing page that presents the user with a button that takes the user to the Authorization page, which is identical to the default one created according to the tutorial at <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory-b2c?view=aspnetcore-5.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory-b2c?view=aspnetcore-5.0</a></p>\n<p>I would like the user to be redirected to a specific page once they complete the login procedure- not back to the landing page (and not to a page they were on with an [authorize] tag that they weren't authorized to access).  I have tried setting returnUrl to the url of the page I want the user to be directed to after login ( Navigation.NavigateTo($&quot;authentication/login?returnUrl=http://localhost:5000/Start&quot;); ), but we are still directed back to the root page.</p>\n"
