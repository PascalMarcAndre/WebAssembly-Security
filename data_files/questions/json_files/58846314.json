    "title": "How do I implement OIDC authentication in Blazor WebAssembly?",
    "body": "<p>I am working on a PoC Project to verify blazor to be the right technology for our company internal web frontend applications. We have an internal identity provider (IdentityServer4 impl.) which I want to authenticate with. In the older projects where angular is being used, we use the javascript oidc client with implicit flow. As far as I understand OIDC, implicit flow should be perfectly fine for a blazor WebAssembly single page application. We have no dedicated server application for that particular frontend, just a few microservices where the frontend fetches data and therefore needs to provide an access token. </p>\n\n<p>An OIDC client library or some example code (ideally both) would be really helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!</p>\n"
