    "title": "How to include first a CMake generated config.h conflicting with 3rd party files?",
    "body": "<p>I use CMake to generate a config.h file. I thought it was better to generate it in the build folder and not the source folder, because it will not be committed in the versioning system.<br>\nBecause of that, I had to add an include directory to my target, and include my file like <code>&lt;config.h&gt;</code> instead of <code>\"config.h\"</code>.</p>\n\n<pre><code>set(GENERATED_HEADER_DIR ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/geninclude)\n\nexecute_process(COMMAND git describe\n                OUTPUT_VARIABLE version_description\n                OUTPUT_STRIP_TRAILING_WHITESPACE)\n\nconfigure_file(\"${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/src/config.h.in\"\n               \"${GENERATED_HEADER_DIR}/config.h\")\n\n# ... target configuration\n\ntarget_include_directories(my_target\n                           PRIVATE ${GENERATED_HEADER_DIR}\n                           PRIVATE ${SOME_LIB_I_NEED})\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My problem is: some lib has aslo exposed a <em>config.h</em> file and the both files are messing up each other during the build.</p>\n\n<p>Edit: the project is built to webassembly so apparently it needs to compile everything at once and cannot link to bin libs as it is usually done with C++ projects.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p>Is there a way to to include my own generated file with <code>\".h\"</code> instead of <code>&lt;.h&gt;</code> without putting the file into my <em>src</em> dir?</p>\n\n<p>Or it there a way to prioritize the include so my code will include my generated file and the lib includes its own? I don't think I can modify the lib CMake config though...</p>\n"
