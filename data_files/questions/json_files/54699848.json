    "body": "<p>When I run chromium on --mo-sandbox, that mean have a way to access local system? I guess not?</p>\n\n<p>Actually, I wonder why have not some fork for this project (Chromium), that give ability access local system/ For these situation that app run locally. In such way, we can run full application on browser without extra level as node (Electron or ECF. etc..). </p>\n\n<p>Rather than, I not understand why not have JS lib to connect to database directly from the browser. Or at least from Webassembly?</p>\n"
