    "title": "Blazor Publish Failed",
    "body": "<p>I'm doing some tests with Blazor and WebAssembly and I've been following a few of the tutorials over at <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/?view=aspnetcore-3.1</a></p>\n\n<p>I can build and run my test project just fine. However, when I try to publish either the Blazor Client or Blazor Server in Visual Studio 2019, I get an error message that says:</p>\n\n<pre><code>Publish failed\nPublish has encountered an error.\nObject reference not set to an instance of an object.\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>It then makes reference to a log file, which I've checked and it contains the following.</p>\n\n<pre><code>System.NullReferenceException: Object reference not set to an instance of an object.\nat Microsoft.Publish.Framework.Provider.DefaultPublishTabProvider.CreatePublishServiceProvider(IVsHierarchy hierarchy)\nat Microsoft.Publish.Framework.Provider.DefaultPublishTabProvider.CreateViewAsync(IVsHierarchy project, IAsyncServiceProvider serviceProvider, CancellationToken cancellationToken)\nat Microsoft.Publish.Framework.Provider.PublishProjectDesignerTabProvider.&lt;CreateViewAsync&gt;d__7.MoveNext()\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I'm not sure if this is a bug because Blazor WebAssembly is still in preview or if there is something wrong with my set up. I've tried googling this error, but it turns up very little.</p>\n\n<p>So I'm just wondering if anyone else that has had a play with Blazor and WebAssembly has seen this error before and if they worked out how to solve it?</p>\n"
