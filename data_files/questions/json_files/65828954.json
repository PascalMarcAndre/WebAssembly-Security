    "title": "Blazor Webassembly with IdentityServer4 logout missing id_token_hint",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to logout using Blazor Webassebly Authentication from my IdentityServer4 provider. The end_session endpoint is called however the id_token_hint is missing:</p>\n<pre><code>http://identity/connect/endsession?post_logout_redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Flocalhost%3A5000%2Fauthentication%2Flogout-callback&amp;state=3157802cb37d41e18da4ee690aca416d\n</code></pre>\n<p>It seems that this causes the post_logout_redirect_uri to be ignored as described in the identityserver4 <a href=\"https://identityserver4.readthedocs.io/en/latest/endpoints/endsession.html\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">documentation</a>:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>post_logout_redirect_uri</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>If a valid id_token_hint is passed, then the client may also send a post_logout_redirect_uri parameter. This can be used to allow the user to redirect back to the client after sign-out. The value must match one of the client\u2019s pre-configured PostLogoutRedirectUris (client docs).</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Since the id_token_hint is missing the post_logout_redirect_uri is forgotten and thus the user is not redirected back after logout.</p>\n<pre><code> await interaction.GetLogoutContextAsync(logoutId);\n</code></pre>\n<p>On IdentityServer4 shows that the PostLogoutRedriectUri is infact null which proves my hypothesis.</p>\n<p>Since the call to the end_session endpoint is handled by Blazor Webassembly Authentication I have no idea where to look as to why its missing.</p>\n<p>I have made sure that identityserver4 is configured correctly with matching PostLogoutRedirectURIs.</p>\n"
