    "body": "<p>I created a Blazor WebAssembly Hosted App with Identity Server4 and ASP.Net Core Identity using this Template:</p>\n<pre><code>dotnet new blazorwasm -au Individual -ho -o {APP NAME}\n</code></pre>\n<p>I followed and read this documentation:\n<a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-identity-server?view=aspnetcore-5.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio-code\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-identity-server?view=aspnetcore-5.0&amp;tabs=visual-studio-code</a></p>\n<p>Can somebody explain how to customize Identity Login and Register Pages and Logic?\nIn MVC you scaffold the Identity Pages you want and they replace those from the dll.\nIf I try to add some Pages on the Server project, how do I have to serve them? Do I need to create\na Pages/Shared/_Layout like in a normal Razor Pages App or can I serve them with BlazorServer SignalR ?\nThe Layout from the Client App should be the same for Identity. Or is this something you have to configure with IdentityServer4 ? Maybe somebody can explain how exactly IdentityServer4 and ASP.NET Core Identity are coupled in this template scenario. I also read some blogs about using only Core Identity for securing BlazorWasm Hosted, can you tell me the difference?</p>\n"
