    "body": "<p>I created a default Blazor Webassembly app with checked Progressive Web App and ASP.NET Core hosted.\n<br>Then I changed the applicationUrl in both launchsettings.json files (server and client).</p>\n<pre><code>&quot;applicationUrl&quot;: &quot;https://0.0.0.0:5001;http://0.0.0.0:5000&quot;,\n I can open the browser with my local address (192.168.1.5:5000 calls the App).\n</code></pre>\n<p>After changing the launchsettings.json on either Server or Client app I can't get the &quot;install&quot; button for the progressive webapp anymore in my browser.\nAlso Visual Studio won't open the browser automatically anymore to open up the browser with the address.</p>\n<p>Any clues? Is that a bug?</p>\n<p><em><strong>When I change the startup url in the project settings -&gt; Debug it also won't open the browser.</strong></em></p>\n<p>There are no exceptions or logs in the output or console.</p>\n<p>I just want the app to be available in my private network for a proof of concept if I can install it as PWA on my phone and so on.</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance</p>\n"
