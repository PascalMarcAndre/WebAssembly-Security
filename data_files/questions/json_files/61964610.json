    "title": "ASP.Net Core Hosted Blazor Webassembly with Azure AD authentication - Separate app registrations for server and client apps",
    "body": "<p>I am trying to create ASP.Net Core Hosted Blazor Webassembly with Azure AD authentication. As per this <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/blazor/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory?view=aspnetcore-3.1\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">document</a>, Microsoft suggests creating separate app registrations for the server api and the client app. </p>\n\n<p>My question is: is it possible to use the same client id instead of the 2 separate mentioned in the document, since it really is 1 project/artifact (containing the static blazor site + web api) that will be deployed into Azure. Will there be an issue if only 1 app registration is used?</p>\n"
