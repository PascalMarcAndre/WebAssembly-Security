    "title": "How can I inspect x86/x64 code generated by V8 from WebAssembly?",
    "body": "<p><a href=\"https://webassembly.studio/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://webassembly.studio/</a> allows inspection of WebAssembly (WASM) files and the corresponding SpiderMonkey-generated x86 code. <em>I'd like to similarly inspect instructions generated by V8's WASM compilers (Liftoff and TurboFan)</em>.</p>\n\n<p>I'm entirely unfamiliar with V8's codebase/API (I compiled &amp; linked it and followed some tutorials, though). There seems to be a <code>v8::CompiledWasmModule</code> class available, but it does not seem to expose access to generated x86/x64 instructions by either Liftoff or TurboFan.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://v8.dev/docs/webassembly-opcode\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">WebAssembly - adding a new opcode</a> describes the process of adding a WASM opcode to V8. Seemingly appropriate functions for WASM compilation/execution are available in the mentioned classes. Though, these seem rather deeply layered within the V8 codebase and would be difficult to access were I to link V8 as a library. Also, I'm unsure if this corresponds to Liftoff or TurboFan.</p>\n\n<p>Could anybody familiar with the V8 codebase give me some pointers as to how I can access Liftoff and/or TurboFan's WebAssembly compilation module, as to obtain x86/x64 code?</p>\n"
