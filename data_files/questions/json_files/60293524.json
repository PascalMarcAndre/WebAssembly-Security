    "body": "<p>This is an experimental project of mine related to remote browser isolation. I'm trying to intercept <a href=\"https://skia.org/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Skia</a> draw commands in a running Chromium instance and later replay them in a different browser instance at client-side via <a href=\"https://skia.org/user/modules/canvaskit\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">CanvasKit</a>, a WebAssembly build of Skia.</p>\n\n<p>However, I'm having a hard time figuring out where and how to intercept those draw commands within Chromium source code. Any advice on how to approach my problem is much appreciated!</p>\n"
