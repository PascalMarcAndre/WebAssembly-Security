    "body": "<p>I have followed this tutorial to add authorization and authentication to my WebAssembly app using Azure AD B2C. <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory-b2c?view=aspnetcore-5.0\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/blazor/security/webassembly/hosted-with-azure-active-directory-b2c?view=aspnetcore-5.0</a></p>\n<p>I have done the tutorial, and done no extra adjustment to the code. However, i am facing an issue when trying to login when running the app.</p>\n<p>The resource is not working because the URL the app is using is wrong. It uses this: <a href=\"https://easytimeslot.b2clogin.comeasytimeslot.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_customuserflow/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://easytimeslot.b2clogin.comeasytimeslot.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_customuserflow/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration</a></p>\n<p>Instead of using this: <a href=\"https://easytimeslot.b2clogin.com/easytimeslot.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_customuserflow/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://easytimeslot.b2clogin.com/easytimeslot.onmicrosoft.com/b2c_1_customuserflow/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration</a></p>\n<p>Now what have i tried so far to fix it. I tried editing the appsettings.json file, and adding a trailing slash to the Instance and i tried a starting slash in the Domain. None of the them worked.</p>\n<p>I also tried looking through the code for the URL, but couldn't find anything.</p>\n<p>Does anyone know what i can do to solve this?\nThank you in advance!</p>\n"
