    "title": "Make one simple C# static function a WebAssembly",
    "body": "<p>I have a 20-line string manipulation static C# method that doesn't have a dependency on any IO or any 3rd party lib. In other words, it is self contained.</p>\n\n<pre><code>public static string Manipulate (string val) {\n    string results;\n    // Do string manip stuff to val\n    return results;\n}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>I want to use a similar functionality in JavaScript to do what this function does, which might create a difference between the server side and the client side. Alternatively, this can be an Ajax call to maintain the same behaviour on client and server.</p>\n\n<p>WebAssembly is another option, but I didn't find much about C# and WebAssembly and Blazor is too much for what we are looking for.</p>\n\n<p>Given this is an internal app, so browser permissions are not an issue and the browsers used are the evergreen ones.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any tutorial to guide us through compiling a simple C# method to wasm? The requirement is to read one textbox \"TextBoxInput\" pass the input to the function on change and put the results in another textbox \"TextBoxOutput\".</p>\n"
