    "title": "Blazor Webassembly Authenticated Event",
    "body": "<p>When authenticating users with Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly.Authentication, in a Blazor Webassembly application on the client side app that is hosted on ASP.NET Core (latest, blazor), when/how to call an action every time a user is authenticated? Even if they come back to the app and have an active session.</p>\n<p><strong>Update 2020-07-15:</strong>\nThe problem I am trying to overcome is that we have a service that goes to Graph API once a user logs in (MSAL) to get their info and profile image. After they log in, I use the RemoteAuthenticatorView.OnLogInSucceeded event to know when they actually logged in. Trouble is, if they then refresh the page (F5), the service loses the Graph info. I guess what I'm actually trying to achieve is to persist session data.</p>\n"
