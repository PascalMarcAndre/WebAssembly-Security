    "title": "Can you exploit emscripten-compiled Wasm to run arbitrary JavaScript?",
    "body": "<p>I'm trying to understand the threat level of the following scenario in a web application:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Web app contains a C++ component compiled to Wasm by Emscripten</li>\n<li>Runs 3rd party Wasm blobs (assume fully untrusted)</li>\n<li>Assume neither blob can call back to JS via import/export</li>\n<li>All Wasm blobs share memory</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>So, obviously a malicious blob could clobber the memory used by the C++ component. I'm wondering how likely it is that it could somehow run arbitrary JS in the context of the web app, ie. inject a script via some of the hooks emscripten puts into Module.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks!!</p>\n"
