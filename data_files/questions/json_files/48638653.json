    "body": "<p>What is the meaning of \"one-pass verification\"? And why a stack based machine can simplify this process?</p>\n\n<p>Also, I find the following sentence in the WebAssembly doc \"Semantic->Validation\" section:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>A module binary must be validated before it is compiled.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I would like to know when the validation process will occur? During the process of \"wat2wasm\" or at any other stage? Thanks!</p>\n"
