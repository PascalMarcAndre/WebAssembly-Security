    "body": "<p>Using AddOidcAuthentication and linking to AWS Cognito service resulting in a huge delay between start of the auth process and redirecting to AWS for sign in.  This appears even using a very vanilla Blazor app and add in support for authentication as per Microsoft Docs.  Looking to see if anyone else I experiencing this issue and or workaround/fix?</p>\n\n<p>Json options very simple</p>\n\n<p><div class=\"snippet\" data-lang=\"js\" data-hide=\"false\" data-console=\"true\" data-babel=\"false\">\r\n<div class=\"snippet-code\">\r\n<pre class=\"snippet-code-js lang-js prettyprint-override\"><code>  \"OidcProviderOptions\": {\r\n    \"Authority\": \"https://cognito-idp.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com/eu-west-XXXXXXXXX\",\r\n    \"ClientId\": \"CLIENT_ID\"\r\n  },</code></pre>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</p>\n\n<p>Auth process initially throws an error due to 'X-Frame-Options' to 'DENY' imposed by Cognito.  There then follows a 10 second delay before it redirects to the login screen - no other requests present during that time.</p>\n"
