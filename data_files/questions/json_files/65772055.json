    "title": "Blazor webassembly pwa session storage not persisting after deployment to Azure",
    "body": "<p>I am developing a Blazor webassembly pwa, locally running the project will store the user in the session storage and keep them there.</p>\n<p>But when I deploy to Azure (linux app service) the session/local storage is not persisting. So when navigating to a different page (within my application) or refreshing the page the oidc.user variable is removed from the session storage and therefor my user is logged out.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zFMj.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/5zFMj.png\" alt=\"local working session storage\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Locally it's working and the key pair will persist.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lcMQx.png\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/lcMQx.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\" /></a></p>\n<ul>\n<li>When deployed to Azure the same key will be added after loggin in succesfully but after a redirect it's removed.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So the real question is: <strong>Why is my session storage working locally but does it remove the oidc.user key pair after a redirect, Causing the user to be logged out.</strong></p>\n"
