    "title": "Using Azure B2C login to access Microsoft Graph is the social login is a Microsoft account",
    "body": "<p>I have an application (Blazor WebAssembly in my case but I believe this scenario applies to other application types as well) that uses the excellent (and convenient) <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/overview\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Azure B2C login services</a> to allow my users to register and log in using either a local account or some social accounts. In particular, I am supporting logging in with a Microsoft account. Once a user is logged in using his Microsoft account I want to give the user the option to save content on OneDrive without the user having to provide credentials again to access the <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Microsoft Graph API</a>.</p>\n<p>In the returned claims after logging in using Azure B2C API I see that there is a <strong>idp</strong> claim (that's how I can determine if the user is logged in using a Microsoft account) and there is also a <strong>idp_access_token</strong> claim but it is not a valid JWT to use against the Microsoft Graph unfortunately.</p>\n<p><strong>What is the nature of the <em>idp_access_token</em>? How can I use it to access the Microsoft Graph and request additional scopes?</strong></p>\n"
