    "body": "<p>I am working on a weekend project that aggregates downloads from other sites in a zip file with Blazor (webassmbly).</p>\n\n<p>The zip file is created in c# code and need to be saved on the local computer. I am using a modified version of <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/53822526/3138087\">this answer</a> because the file size can easily extend over 400 mb.</p>\n\n<p>My Version partitions the js call to not imminently overflow the webassembly VM but after a certain filesize it happens and i get the folloring exception:</p>\n\n<pre><code>WASM: Try saving 213776418bytes --my message\nblazor.webassembly.js:1 WASM: GC_MAJOR_SWEEP: major size: 1808K in use: 94964K\nblazor.webassembly.js:1 WASM: GC_MAJOR: (LOS overflow) time 71.98ms, stw 72.00ms los size: 486832K in use: 481083K\nWASM: \ufeffError: Garbage collector could not allocate 16384 bytes of memory for major heap section.\nUncaught (in promise) ExitStatus\u00a0{name: \"ExitStatus\", message: \"Program terminated with exit(1)\", status: 1}\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Is there currently any other way to save a file from WebAssembly other then transferring the file content to js and then save them with Blob? </p>\n"
