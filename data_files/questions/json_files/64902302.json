    "body": "<p>I'm using Blazor webassembly with Azure ADB2C. A typical task is to retrieve only those records for the logged in user.  Which field from AzureB2C is the best practice to use as the authorized user's primary key?</p>\n<p>I assumed that using the object ID which is a guid and created by Azure ADB2C would be the correct unique field. However I also see examples on the internet using either the user's email and/or user's name.</p>\n<p>I plan on using this field as as a unique field in database tables for the user.</p>\n"
