    "body": "<p>When using ADB2C for authentication in a Blazor Webassembly project, the authentication/logout seems to log out and shows a page with the request to close all browsers. \nAnyway if the user just uses the back button in the browser she/he is still able to access the contents and is treated as still loged-on.\nSo, how to get a real logout? </p>\n"
