    "title": "ASP.NET Core how to change policy requirements based on user selection",
    "body": "<p>In my Blazor webassembly project I can see all roles, delete and add new ones. I can also assign a role to a user and authenticate the user based on that.</p>\n<p>Now I have for example my <code>RolesController.cs</code>:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang-cs prettyprint-override\"><code>// GET: api/Persons\n[Authorize(Policy = &quot;SeeAllRoles&quot;)]\n[HttpGet]\npublic async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IEnumerable&lt;IdentityRole&gt;&gt;&gt; GetRoles()\n{\n     return await _roleManager.Roles.ToListAsync();\n}\n\n// GET api/&lt;RolesController&gt;/5\n[Authorize(Policy = &quot;GetRole&quot;)]\n[HttpGet(&quot;{id}&quot;)]\npublic async Task&lt;ActionResult&lt;IdentityRole&gt;&gt; GetRole(string id)\n{\n    var role = await _roleManager.Roles.FirstOrDefaultAsync(r =&gt; r.Id == id);\n    if (role == null)\n    {\n        return NotFound();\n    }\n    return role;\n}\n</code></pre>\n<p>Every controller has a unique policy for each action. So that I can restrict each action individually. Normally I would just define the policy in <code>Startup.cs</code>, add <code>.RequireRole(&quot;Admin&quot;)</code> or something to it and now every user in this role would have access to the policy I specified.</p>\n<p>To the question: I want to have a list of roles, as I have now, with the ability to select which policy should be included in this role. So that I can login to my application go to <code>Roles</code> and add a new role <code>NewsDisplay</code> and only select policies necessary to view the news feed. Then I can add users for my various displays and put all of them in the newly created <code>NewsDisplay</code> role.</p>\n<p>I guess this is possible but can\u00b4t find a sufficient solution to this. Would be nice if someone could give me examples, links, ideas.</p>\n"
