    "body": "<p>I have created a new Blazor WebAssembly project with a separate API project. My WebAssembly project will\nquery this WebAPI for data.</p>\n<p>I have included <code>Identity</code> in my app and this seems to work. I can register a new user and use the below code to log in a user on my Web API.</p>\n<p>Code used to log someone in:</p>\n<pre><code>    var result = await _signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(model.UserName, model.Password, false, lockoutOnFailure: false);\n\n     if (result.Succeeded)\n     {\n         //I arrive here, so login was succesful\n         return true;\n     }\n</code></pre>\n<p>So Identity seems to be working.</p>\n<p>What I'm wondering now is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>my user logs on in the web assembly app</li>\n<li>this app uses HttpClient to send a request to my server to authenticate the user, using a username and password</li>\n<li>the server checks the username and password and uses <code>_signInManager.PasswordSignInAsync(username, password)</code> which works</li>\n<li>How does my client know which user has been authenticated? How can I display more information about this user, check his roles, ...</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Does anyone have any guidance or best practices on this please?</p>\n"
