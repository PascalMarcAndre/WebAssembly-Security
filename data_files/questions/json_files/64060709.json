    "body": "<p>Good afternoon!\nI apologize in advance for a possibly stupid question.</p>\n<p>I recently asked a question about connecting Blazor WebAssembly to a database. They explained to me that it was necessary to use the API and left me a link to lessons from Microsoft. Here it is: <a href=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-3.1&amp;tabs=visual-studio</a></p>\n<p>I started doing a lesson and to test the functionality of the API, it was necessary to send requests. And at this point I have matured questions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><p>I could send requests creating new positions without any account verification. It turns out, in general, everyone can safely send such requests to the site, creating new products?</p>\n</li>\n<li><p>How to protect yourself from the above?</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n"
