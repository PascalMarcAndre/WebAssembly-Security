    "title": "webassembly (C) How can I create configuration files?",
    "body": "<p>I would like to create configuration for my webassembly app. It just needs to be able to store some key-value pairs: whether it's JSON, XML, .cfg, .csv or .txt any will do. Is it possible to do this with webassembly? Do I need to serve the config files or how will the configuration file need to be delivered to the client? What path will I use to open the file?</p>\n<p>Further info:\nI'm using straight C with emcc. My build command is:</p>\n<pre><code>emcc \\\nmain.c \\\n-s USE_SDL=2 \\\n-O3 \\\n-s WASM=1 \\\n-o main.js \n</code></pre>\n<p>I am not exposing anything to javascript. It's all wasm manipulating the canvas with SDL. I haven't written any javascript.</p>\n<p>I'm currently serving with Python's simple http server using <code>python3 -m http.server 8080</code></p>\n<p>I have already tried using libconfig but I got stuck with compiling it and having it find the config file.</p>\n"
