    "body": "<p>I created .NET Core hosted Blazor webassembly project with identity server using Visual Studio template. Any idea how I should change the configuration if I want the whole Blazor compiled client code to be available only to authenticated users? </p>\n\n<p>Now everyone can access client side app compiled code even if I secure all Blazor routes with <code>[Authorize]</code> because single-page-app is downloaded as a single entity to the browser. I do not want to make compiled code available publicly to users who don't even have access to app. </p>\n"
