    "title": "Blazor hosted - authorize immediately before displaying application",
    "body": "<p>Can anybody give me a helping push to get my hosted Blazor application (Client, Server and Shared) to request a login immediately, before the application is initially shown. I want the experience that a user must log in before accessing the application at all.</p>\n\n<p>My starting point is the Blazor Webassembly (hosted) template with Api Authorization (Individual User Accounts)</p>\n\n<p>Using the <code>Authorize</code> attribute on either server-side actions or a client-side Razor page will not initiate the authentication flow before the specific action/page with the <code>Authorize</code> attribute is being requested by the user. How would I go about having the authorization flow kicked off as the first thing, before the application is even displayed for the first time? </p>\n\n<p>I am sure this is possible and even trivial for somebody more savvy than me. Can anybody give me a shove in the right direction, please?</p>\n"
