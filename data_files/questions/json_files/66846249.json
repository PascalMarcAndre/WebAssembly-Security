    "title": "Question about local db used by BlazingPizza Blazor app",
    "body": "<p>I am studying the demo Blazor WebAssembly project located here <a href=\"https://github.com/dotnet-presentations/blazor-workshop\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">BlazingPizza</a></p>\n<p>This project uses a local SqlLite database called &quot;Pizza.db&quot; for authentication and app-related data storage. I am trying to understand how will this db file be downloaded to the browser? Is it a hidden resource file and user has no access to it? If so, would such db file be a good solution to use instead of localStorage since user can easily manipulate localStorage values? Thanks for any advice.</p>\n"
