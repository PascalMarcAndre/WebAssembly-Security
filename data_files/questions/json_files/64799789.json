Please check network and try again. Detail: TypeError: NetworkError when attempting to fetch resource.'</p>\n<p>In the debug window the message is displayed: Microsoft .AspNetCore.Authorization.DefaultAuthorizationService[2] Authorization failed. These requirements were not met: DenyAnonymousAuthorizationRequirement: Requires an authenticated user.</p>\n<p>In the Microsoft instructions for this error message the recommendation is in Azure for the app set the manifest setting of allowPublicClient to null or true. I set this attribute for both the server app and the client app to true but this did not make a difference.</p>\n"
