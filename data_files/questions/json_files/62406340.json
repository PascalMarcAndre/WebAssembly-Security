    "body": "<p>I have a Blazor WebAssembly app that uses Azure AD B2C for authentication.</p>\n\n<pre><code>builder.Services.AddMsalAuthentication(options =&gt;\n{\n    builder.Configuration.Bind(\"AzureAdB2C\", options.ProviderOptions.Authentication);\n});\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>When the user is redirected to authentication, Blazor display the login in a pop-up.</p>\n\n<p>The problem with the pop-up is that the user could bury it if they clicked on the screen outside of the pop-up.</p>\n\n<p>Wondering if there is a way to force the authentication to redirect to the page as opposed to displaying the pop-up.</p>\n"
