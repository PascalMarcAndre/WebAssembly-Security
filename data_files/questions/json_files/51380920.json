    "body": "<p>I have a WebAssembly module running in a WebWorker. This module contains a session key for encryption and other sensitive data I want to memzero before the page is closed.</p>\n\n<p>Is there any way to reliably do this for different Browsers?</p>\n\n<p>If not are there any good alternatives? I could intercept onbeforeunload to encourage the user to use the logout button, but as I understand it not all browsers will allow me to send the user a custom message.</p>\n"
