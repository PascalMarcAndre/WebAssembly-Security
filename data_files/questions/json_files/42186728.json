    "title": "Could webassembly be a way to enforce drm?",
    "body": "<p>The Idea of using compiled languages on might be a great way to increase performance significantly.  </p>\n\n<p>But could it used to set a drm?</p>\n\n<p>For example: Some website offers browser games and doesn't want the source code to be used by others. Would webassembly-script tied deep into the game mechanics be used to detect if it is used on another site and lock it down with no way to decompile and bypass it?</p>\n\n<p>I don't want to sound like a pirate with this, but it might concern adblock-users, that <a href=\"https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">also block trackers</a>.  </p>\n\n<p>When for example a <a href=\"https://audiofingerprint.openwpm.com/\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">Audio Context Fingerprinting</a>-script is run behind without being detected, how can it be blocked?</p>\n"
