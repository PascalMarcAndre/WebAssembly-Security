    "title": "Blazor WebAssembly invoking protected WebAPI methods and relaying bearer token",
    "body": "<p>I have a restful service running on localhost:5002, Identity server on 5000 and Blazor WebAssembly app on localhost:1330. There is probably something going on with they're not all on the same domain. </p>\n\n<p>I can authenticate with my Blazor WebAssembly app (Client not server) Which inturn calls WebApi methods, I get returned, 401 not authorised. I've manually added the bearer token to the requests and it works perfectly returning results etc. </p>\n\n<pre><code>HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = new AuthenticationHeaderValue(\"Bearer\", \"{{BEARER TOKEN VALUE}}\");\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>My main question is. What's the best way to get the Bearer token and pass it on? </p>\n"
