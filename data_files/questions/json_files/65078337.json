    "body": "<p>I am new to Blazor development. When I first create a Blazor WebAssembly app and debug it on IIS, the app opens in the browser (Chrome), however, it opens on a new window where I am not signed in. This behavior is different from ASP.NET MVC apps or even Blazor server-side apps.</p>\n<p>I am trying to understand why is this the case, will it behave like this all the time, is this changeable, and whether or not I should use it. I couldn't find any resource about this on the internet.</p>\n"
