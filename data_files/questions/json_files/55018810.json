    "body": "<p>I'm using a webassembly file compiled by Emscripten in my project.\nAnd since my project uses Webpack, it renames all files, then the Emscripten module can't find more the webassembly file.</p>\n\n<p>Then I need to get the new filename of the webassembly file to can load it.</p>\n\n<p>I found <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/surma/b2705b6cca29357ebea1c9e6e15684cc\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">this workaround</a>, but I want a better solution, because I don't want do change the <code>webpack.config.js</code> with configurations about the <code>.wasm</code> files.</p>\n\n<p>Explain the context: I have a project called <code>bursh</code> that it uses Webpack and imports a module called <code>scissors</code> which it has the webassembly files. So I'm looking for a solution which doesn't need to update the configurations, because of the isolation of responsibilities - doesn't make sense to set configurations at <code>brush</code> for some reason by <code>scissors</code></p>\n"
