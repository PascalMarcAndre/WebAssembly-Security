    "title": "Windows Authentication using Blazor with .Net Core WebApi",
    "body": "<p>I have the task to develop a Blazor Webassembly App. This app is only used within the companys network and for security reasons we would like to use the existing AD and NTLM Authentication.</p>\n<p>So far I have a minimal Blazor App configured and running in IIS. Its configured to use Windows Authentication and that works so far. When I open the app in Browser I get asked for my credentials.\nThe app should also communicate with a .net core webapi which is also secured by windows authentication. This webapi security too works as it should. When I open an URL to it in Browser I get asked for my credentials and the page loads as it should.</p>\n<p>Now the Problem: When I call the same url (that works in Browser) from my Blazor app with HttpClient.GetAsync I get an &quot;401: Not Authorized&quot; error. Even though the app itself is loaded with the same authentication. Is there something I have to do?\nThe MSDN Documenations a gigantic and I couldnt find a Solution.</p>\n<p>In the WebApi Startup.cs in ConfigureServices() I added</p>\n<pre><code>services.AddAuthentication(IISDefaults.AuthenticationScheme);\nservices.AddAuthorization();\n</code></pre>\n<p>and in Configure()</p>\n<pre><code>app.UseCors(x =&gt; x.AllowAnyMethod().AllowAnyHeader().SetIsOriginAllowed(origin =&gt; true).AllowCredentials());\napp.UseAuthentication();\napp.UseAuthorization();\n</code></pre>\n<p>PS:\nThe Blazor App uses .NET Core 3.1\nThe WebApi uese .NET 5.0</p>\n"
