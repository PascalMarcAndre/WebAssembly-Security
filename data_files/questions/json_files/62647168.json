    "title": "Blazor Client-side Hosted ASP for authentication access to the application",
    "body": "<p>I want to create an application with Blazor webassembly however I do have need for Active Directory to act as initial authentication based on Identity name. Can I use Active Directory on premises to get the user and user group then use JWT as a means to control the authorization afterwards? I was attempting this but only got as far as using JWT and roles based on the JWT token, but attempts to use <code>User.Identity.Name</code> on the controller fails to get the system user Identity currently.</p>\n"
