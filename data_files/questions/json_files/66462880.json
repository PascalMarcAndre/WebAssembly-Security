    "body": "<p>I am trying to use a custom tflite model on browser.\nA simple C++ file reads the model and interprets it. This C++ file is converted to WebAssembly to be able to run on browser.\nThe tflite model is basically a FlatBuffer file, Want to know how can I encrypt it.\nI am looking for a fast encryption/decryption method implemented on C++.</p>\n<p>I would implement the decryption code with the key on the C++ file, And as it would be converted to WebAssembly, No one would be able to access the original C++ file and get the key.</p>\n"
