They rarely work without problems. Sometimes cleaning web cache from Settings / Safari / Advanced Settings is solves problem. Unfortunately, this error is coming up again soon.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4GOp.gif\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\"><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/Y4GOp.gif\" alt=\"enter image description here\"></a></p>\n\n<p>I have not any issue on desktop browser, the app running smoothly. I have iPhone X, iPad and iPhone 6. . The app works rarely without problems on X. Seems not run on others. The WebAssembly log on iOS is <a href=\"https://github.com/unoplatform/uno/files/4719089/click.log\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">here</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Is it depends on device RAM size on Apple Device ? The app runs just perfectly on Android WebView.</p>\n"
