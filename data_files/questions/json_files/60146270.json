    "body": "<p>I've installed and <strong>executed</strong> (with nodejs) a package from npm: <a href=\"https://www.npmjs.com/package/openssl.js\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://www.npmjs.com/package/openssl.js</a></p>\n\n<p>Somehow I didn't realize that it hasn't a good reputation (almost no activity/stars on twitter, github). Now I'm afraid that it is a scam. The worst case would be that is stealing/encrypting my data or something like that.</p>\n\n<p>I've checked the processes, I/O and network in the activity monitor but nothing interesting.\nBut I would like to have more confidence that everything is okay.</p>\n\n<p>Since it is a Wasm file I cannot just check the source code.\nI've tried to decompile with this tool: <a href=\"https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://github.com/WebAssembly/wabt</a> but it gives me for all binaries in that project this error: <code>error: @0x00000004: bad magic value</code>.</p>\n\n<p>Maybe because in the README of the openssl.js package they claim it is build with wasienv toolchain?</p>\n\n<p>Another idea would be install a honeypot and run the same commands in the honeypot. But which honeypot is suitable for this?</p>\n\n<p>// edit</p>\n\n<p>I was able to run wasm2c on this file: <strong>src/raw-wasm/openssl.wasm</strong>.\nBut how can I ensure there was no network interactivity?<br>\nHere are the first lines of the output: <a href=\"https://pastebin.com/YYHecFAC\" rel=\"nofollow noreferrer\">https://pastebin.com/YYHecFAC</a></p>\n"
