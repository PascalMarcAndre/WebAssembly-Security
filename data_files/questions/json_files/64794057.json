    "body": "<p>In my Blazor Webassembly app, I'm trying to hook into the authentication workflow so that I can direct my users to a specific page within my application after they successfully log in. My identity provider is Auth0, and all of that is working fine, but I can't get my application to redirect to where I want AFTER it finishes the round trip with Auth0.</p>\n<p>I've tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Setting a method to the OnLogInSucceeded in my RemoteAuthenticatorView that uses the NavManager to redirect to my intended landing page; this does nothing that I can see</li>\n<li>Setting an action in the CompletingLoggingIn child element of the RemoteAuthenticatorView; this succeeds for a moment before redirecting again to the index</li>\n<li>Hooking into the AuthenticationStateChanged event on the AuthenticationStateProvider to use the NavManager to redirect; this does nothing that I can see</li>\n</ul>\n"
