    "body": "<p>I have created a small .NET 5.0 Web API where a users can register/login to create/add/delete notes. The API is working fine, after the login I receive the JWT token in the response back.</p>\n<p>Now I want to create a Blazor Webassembly website which will communicate with the API.\nThe problem I have is that I don't know where to start and what do I need to get the web page take the Token from the response and how to work with it to be authorized when doing API calls.</p>\n<p>In the API i have used the IHttppAccesor to get access to the user data from the JWT token, is it similar to work with the token for the authorization.</p>\n<p>Any suggestions what to use or where to start would be greatly appreciated!</p>\n"
